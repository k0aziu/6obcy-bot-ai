# AI Chatbot Integration with You.com on 6obcy

I was feeling bored, so I decided to create a script that combines AI with You.com on the 6obcy platform. Users can now chat with artificial intelligence on 6obcy. It might seem like a pointless endeavor, but the connection between these two things is quite intriguing.

BY the way, I included instructions on how the WebSocket functionality was implemented on 6obcy (how websockets works in 6obcy).
